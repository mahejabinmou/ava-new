								depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and bipolar
								disorder. Additionally, I have seven years of experience at
								Wilder Foundation as an embedded school therapist, where I
								worked with middle school students identified with social and
								emotional stress disorders that contribute to academic struggles
								and behavioral issues both in school and at home. For three
								years, I served as a crisis therapist at Washburn Center for
								Children, assisting adolescents and their families who were
								recently released from the hospital following a mental health
